**_Portainer_** is a lightweight management UI which allows you to **easily** manage your different Docker environments (Docker hosts or Swarm clusters).

**_Portainer_** is meant to be as **simple** to deploy as it is to use. It consists of a single container that can run on any Docker engine (can be deployed as Linux container or a Windows native container).

**_Portainer_** allows you to manage your Docker containers, images, volumes, networks and more ! It is compatible with the *standalone Docker* engine and with *Docker Swarm mode*.

## Demo

<img src="https://portainer.io/images/screenshots/portainer.gif" width="77%"/>

You can try out the public demo instance: http://demo.portainer.io/ (login with the username **admin** and the password **tryportainer**).

Please note that the public demo cluster is **reset every 15min**.

Alternatively, you can deploy a copy of the demo stack inside a [play-with-docker (PWD)](https://labs.play-with-docker.com) playground:

- Browse [PWD/?stack=portainer-demo/play-with-docker/docker-stack.yml](http://play-with-docker.com/?stack=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/portainer/portainer-demo/master/play-with-docker/docker-stack.yml)
- Sign in with your [Docker ID](https://docs.docker.com/docker-id)
- Follow [these](https://github.com/portainer/portainer-demo/blob/master/play-with-docker/docker-stack.yml#L5-L8) steps.

Unlike the public demo, the playground sessions are deleted after 4 hours. Apart from that, all the settings are same, including default credentials.

## Limitations
